Summary of RFM Analysis on Online Retail Dataset
In this project, we conducted an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on an online retail dataset to identify and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Data Collection:
We used a dataset containing transaction details such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values by removing rows with missing CustomerID.
Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and inconsistencies.
Created a TotalPrice column to represent the total amount spent in each transaction.
RFM Calculation:

Recency: Calculated as the number of days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Counted the number of transactions per customer.
Monetary: Summed the total amount spent by each customer.
RFM Segmentation:

Customers were ranked and scored based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
Combined these scores to create an overall RFM score for each customer.
Segmented customers into groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, Recent Customers, At Risk, and Hibernating.
Insights and Application:
This segmentation provided valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling the development of targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.

This RFM analysis is a crucial tool for enhancing customer relationship management and tailoring marketing efforts to different customer segments.
